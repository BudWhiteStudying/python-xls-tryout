# Python XLSX tryout

## Purpose

The purpose of this (mostly AI-generated) short script is to demonstrate how to handle Excel files with Python.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

The script relies on package `openpyxl`, which must be installed:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execution

In its raw form, the script takes no input parameters; therefore, execution boils down to:

```bash
python ./read_and_write.py
```
